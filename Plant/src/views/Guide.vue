     <h2>I'm sure you have a great interest in growing plants, but just in case you don't know where to start, below we'll give you some general steps and tutorials to help you get started with an enjoyable growing experience!</h2>
    </section>
  <section>
     <h2>Shop at a reputable plant supplier.</h2>
     <h3>At a nursery or garden center, you can not only buy good quality indoor plants, but you can also learn a lot about gardening from the experts there. You can also buy indoor plants at home stores or grocery stores, however, these plants are not grown by them, but are bought wholesale. In other words, they cannot guarantee the quality of these plants. There is also a risk that indoor potted plants sold in home stores or grocery stores usually cannot be returned or exchanged.</h3>
     <h3>When evaluating the merits of a nursery, first check if the nursery environment is clean and hygienic, and second, see if all the prices of the nursery's potted plants are lower than the average market price; if so, I'm afraid it means that they are more interested in attracting customers by offering low prices than by offering good-quality potted plants.</h3>
     <h3>Indoor potted plants can also be purchased online or mail order.</h3>

     <h2>Purchase a plant that is adaptable and does not die easily.</h2>
     <h3>If you are a novice, you may want to choose a plant that is easy to care for. Starting with a desert cactus plant is a good choice, but you need to know how to care for it. Plants that are easy to care for include: mallow, caladium, spider huggers, bromeliads, peace lilies, lilies of the valley, African geraniums, bamboos, gladioli, hanging orchids, succulents, cacti, and kidney ferns.</h3>
     <h3>Just because a plant can be found anywhere does not mean it is easy to care for. The fact that it is ubiquitous just because it is easy to propagate in a greenhouse does not mean that it is an easy-to-care-for houseplant.</h3>
    </section>

     <h2>See if the leaves and flowers are healthy</h2>
     <h3>Quality potted plants are not only strikingly shaped, but also have lush green foliage without any spots or blemishes. Follow the main stem and go through the layers of foliage one by one from top to bottom to see if there are any obvious faults. For flowering plants, look for a large number of tightly packed buds and a few blooms, and that the flowers are bright and colorful. See if the leaves and flowers are healthy</h3>
     <h3>Sprouting is a sign of a strong plant. However, some plants are so slow-growing that it is difficult to notice even if there is sprouting.</h3>
    </section>
  <section>
     <h2>Check to see if the root system is healthy.</h2>
     <h3>Gently tug on the plant to see if the main stem is firmly attached to the root system and if the plant is firmly anchored in the pot. If the soil falls off the sides of the pot with a gentle tug, or if the soil dries out and becomes compacted, abandon the pot and pick another one. However, a bunched up root system is not a big problem.</h3>
    </section>
    <section>
     <h2>Ensure proper light and temperature</h2>
     <h3>Provide the right amount of light. If there is a lack of light, the plant's branches become slender and its leaves become tiny. In addition, the colorful leaves of many plants fade to green, and flowering plants no longer bloom. Conversely, if too much light is given for too long, plants become yellow and crinkly, and their leaves wilt. Knowing each plant's specific light needs will help you give it the right amount of light.</h3>
     <h3>Light conditions near a windowsill with direct sunlight would be considered strong light. Cacti, succulents and quite a few indoor potted plants thrive in strong light, while the rest require varying degrees of filtered light.</h3>
     <h3>Light conditions 90 to 150 centimeters away from a windowsill in direct sunlight would be considered medium light. Medium-light light conditions will undoubtedly produce a back-shaded surface, allowing the vast majority of potted plants to thrive in such light conditions.</h3> 
     <h3>Light conditions at the furthest point from a window sill in direct sunlight are considered low light. In low light conditions, the light is dim and unclear, and some potted plants will inevitably grow poorly, although they can tolerate such light conditions without becoming ill.</h3> 
    </section>
  <section>
     <h2>If there is not enough natural light, use artificial lighting.</h2> 
     <h3>Specialized plant grow bulbs and plant filler lights can be purchased at big box stores or garden centers. These lights emit light that is very similar to natural light. Turn the lights on during the day and off at night to allow potted plants to rest at night.</h3>
     <h3>You can also use ordinary household "daylight" bulbs, which do the same thing as plant growth bulbs but are less expensive, but produce a blue-white light.</h3>
     <h3>LED lights use less energy and produce less heat than incandescent, fluorescent and halogen bulbs. With LED lights, plants won't be constantly in an overheated environment, and you'll save energy and power.</h3>

     <h2>Give the right amount of water for different kinds of plants.</h2>
     <h3>Too little water can lead to scorched plants and dry, brittle leaves, while too much water can lead to mold or fungal infections and rotting, smelly plants. Know the specific needs of each plant in order to give it the proper amount of water.</h3>
     <h3>LOW HUMIDITY: Many desert plants prefer low humidity. They do not like high humidity because it can cause mold, fungal infections, and even rot. Therefore, desert plants should be kept in a low humidity environment. Water only when the soil is almost completely dry.</h3>
     <h3>MODERATE HUMIDITY: Many plants require a moderate supply of water and all prefer to stay in a moderately humid environment. When the soil is 25 to 50 percent dry, it needs to be thoroughly watered. Keep a close eye on it so that moisture can be provided in a timely manner.</h3>
     <h3>High Humidity: Some houseplants are real water dolls and especially like plenty of water and high humidity soil. These plants grow better if they are hydroponically grown in glass containers, glass cases or indoor water display boxes, and can even survive if their roots are submerged in water.</h3>
    </section>
  <section>
     <h2>Water as needed.</h2>
     <h3>Insert your finger into the soil in order to feel the dryness. For plants that prefer high humidity, water as soon as the surface of the soil is completely dry, while for plants that prefer medium humidity, insert your finger about 1 cm into the soil to feel how dry it is before watering.</h3>
    </section>
  <section>
     <h2>Watering with the best water</h2>
    <h3>If you have time to prepare, water with room temperature water that has settled overnight. If you have to water immediately, use slightly warm water from the faucet.</h3>
  </section>
<section>
    <h2>You can't mechanically follow a strict watering schedule</h2>
    <h3>Even if the same plant is in the same environment, it will require different amounts of water at different times of the year in different pots. You need to look at each plant as a unique individual. In addition, plants that are placed high in a trellis or planted in a hanging basket planter will require more water than if they were placed in a relatively low position.</h3>
    <h3>When caring for a potted plant that prefers high humidity, it is best to plant it individually and keep a close eye on the plant's changing condition in response to humidity needs. If you find that the leaves are wilting and the edges or tips of the leaves are scorched, it means that the plant lacks water.</h3>
  </section>
<section>
    <h2>Do not spray mist toward potted plants.</h2>
    <h3>Many plants love moisture but hate having water on their leaves, such as hairy foliage plants. Instead of spraying at a potted plant, place it in a wet tray containing pebbles and water, then purchase a plant humidifier and place all of the potted plants in the humidifier's batch processing area. You can also place the potted plant in a glass garden that resembles a greenhouse so that it can draw full moisture.</h3>
    <h3>However, bromeliads and many types of orchids like to be misted with water. In fact, bromeliads like their own leaf cones and tips to store a moderate amount of water, while iron orchids and air bromeliads have water-absorbing scales on their foliage.</h3>
    <h3>When some plants are sprayed with water mist, ugly cola- or coffee-colored spots appear on the surface of the plant, and leathery leaves develop corky spots. The leaves of some plants also turn transparent and soft. White and hard chalky blotches appear on the foliage after spraying plants with hard water sprays.</h3>
    <h3>Splashing cold water on leaves can cause them to rot and wither. Because wet leaves are exposed to direct sunlight, the water droplets on the leaf surface act like magnifying glasses, causing the leaves to burn like paper in the sun.</h3>

    <h2>Fertilize in moderation.</h2>
    <h3>Excessive fertilization can cause the plant to grow weak branches and leaves that can only be cut back. It also causes burn marks on the leaves and white scabs on the soil. Too little fertilizer will cause the plant to stop growing, weaken, slow down its metabolism and start dropping leaves. If you fertilize a flowering plant incorrectly, for example with a high nitrogen fertilizer, it stops flowering and grows poorly.</h3>
    <h3>The three key nutrients plants need are: Nitrogen (N) promotes leaf growth. Phosphorus (P) promotes root, flower, seed and fruit growth. Potassium (K) makes stems grow strong, speeds up water transfer, and promotes flowering and fruiting.</h3>
    <h3>The three nutrients are labeled according to the order of "Nitrogen, Phosphorus and Potassium", and are expressed by connecting numbers and numbers. For example, 10-10-10, 16-4-8. Generally speaking, foliage plants need more nitrogen in the soil, while flowering plants need more potassium and phosphorus in the soil. A good garden center usually has a wide variety of fertilizers specially formulated for different plants to choose from.</h3>

    <h2>Keep a close eye on potted plants for changes in growth and problems, such as pests.</h2>
    <h3>Check regularly to catch problems early before they become serious, otherwise it will be too late to do anything to save them.</h3>
  </section>
<section>
    <h2>The problem or infestation should be addressed as soon as it first occurs.</h2>
    <h3>When pests and diseases are detected, appropriate measures need to be taken as early as possible to kill and treat them. Even if the problem is already serious, it should be dealt with promptly and quickly so that the situation does not deteriorate further.</h3>
    <h3>Many less serious pests and diseases have similar symptoms. Look out for abnormalities that accompany the symptoms, such as yellowing and wilting of the leaves due to drying out of the soil, which can often be seen to have dried out to the point of cracking.</h3>
  </section>
<section>
    <h2>Improve pruning skills.</h2>
    <h3>Promptly remove rotting, dead, deformed leaves and faded or dead flowers, which are the source of disease.</h3>
  </section>
<section>
    <h2>Allow plants to properly dormant.</h2>
    <h3>Many indoor potted plants that are tropical plants do not go dormant at all in their tropical native habitat and grow all the time. Other than that, all other plants have a definite dormant period in order to grow healthily. During the dormant period, which lasts for weeks or months, you only need to supply it with a small amount of water and heat. Many plants only need a small amount of water and heat in the winter, which allows them to flourish and even bloom in the spring.</h3>
    <h3>Dormancy manifests itself differently in different species of plants. For example, evergreen plants simply suspend growth, while deciduous plants drop all their leaves. Bulbous plants such as Calla lilies appear to die above ground, but their bulbs are still alive. Calla lilies in northern climates go dormant during the growing season because this is the time when they are dormant in their native South Africa. Cacti and leafless succulents are not seen to be dormant because they are well adapted to cold, dry winters.</h3>
    <h3>Don't fertilize during the winter or dormant period unless you need to. This is because, at this time, the root system cannot absorb the nutrients in the fertilizer and will be burned by the fertilizer, besides, fertilizing at this time will force the plant to resume active growth, thus causing it to grow weak leaves and flowers.</h3>
  </section>
<section>
    <h2>Watch for signs of poor soil.</h2>
    <h3>Soil consolidation causes water and nutrients to be lost too quickly as it drains, as evidenced by bubbling soil with a seeping sound when watering. If the soil is too solid to breathe, you may find that the plant's leaves are normal, but the stems are weak and fragile.</h3>
    <h3>Other signs include roots that break when tugged lightly, or plants that were once strong but have become weak.</h3>
    <h3>If the soil is too light, taproots and some indoor potted trees will collapse.</h3>
